# Special Note For Everyone
```py
'''
always make more then 4 pull request
lets you have made only 4 pull request to different projects
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be count and 
then you have remains 3 valid pull request if these projects is not excluded.
if you fail to make 4 pull request then you cant get swags or t-shirts.

i will recommend you make pull request to your own repo which is very very saffest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
